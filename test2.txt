== Connect Local Repository To GitHub Repository
But your co-workers can’t see your fantastic new design. That’s because the main project is stored in the company GitHub account (username: Joy2Code) in the repository called “MyProj”
Since you haven’t connected to the GitHub repo yet, your computer doesn’t even know this exists. So tell your local repository about it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Joy2Code/myproj.git


And check to make sure it knows:
git remote -v

Upload all your commited files up to the project:
git push -u origin master
